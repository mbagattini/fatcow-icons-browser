# FatCow Farm-Fresh Icons browser/finder

The web hosting portal [FatCow](https://www.fatcow.com/) distibutes an amazing set of over 3900 icons for free: [the icons are available at this link](https://www.fatcow.com/free-icons).

These are, however, quite challenging to browse locally under Windows as the OS takes a while to render them. Someone smarter than me previously published a simple script to browse them online, [under this repository](https://github.com/wmh/hunbook). 

Long story short, Hunter Wu's html refers to an older iteration of the FatCow collection, I simply extended their script adding the missing icon and support for both 32px and 16px icons.

Head to the live version to search and download the icons, or clone/download the repo to use it locally.
